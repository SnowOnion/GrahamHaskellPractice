When I was reading [Graham Hutton's book "Programming in Haskell"](https://www.amazon.cn/Programming-in-Haskell-Hutton-Professor-Graham/dp/0521692695/ref=sr_1_1) (or [its Douban profile](https://book.douban.com/subject/1951517/)), I wrote down some Haskell program and non-program for practice purpose. Here they are.

Thanks [@cafe2code](https://twitter.com/cafe2code) for recommending this book!
